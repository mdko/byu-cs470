--make sure our network calls are efficient:
	update_loop:
	while (true) 
	{
	--get enemy flag positions
	--get enemy tank positions
	--get our tank positions
	--perform all calculations (augment tank brains accordingly)
	--issue orders to tanks

--make the kalman filter analyze all enemy tanks
--make our tanks all play kalman filter on closest enemy tank
--make our tanks prioritize the closest enemy
--make our tanks prioritize the closest (odd) and second closest enemy (even)
--after 1 minute of game time, have tanks switch to a-star to enemy flag, while shooting ahead of them
--when a tank knows it has the flag, it runs (a-stars) back to its base
--when a friendly tank has the flag, make all tanks stop and use kalman filter to shoot enemy tanks (seek and destroy)
--if enemy flag gets dropped, make tanks go toward that flag
--make our tanks move into formation at the start of the game (around our base)
--make tanks forward acceleration be a function of some randomness (0.25 <= v <= 1.0), changes every 1-2.5 seconds
--be color blind

set of 4 tank states
1] game-setup: make formation that covers our base and ensures they won't shoot each other (~5 seconds)
2] 1st minute defense (shoot at the two nearest enemy tanks)
3] onslaught: all tanks go to get the enemy flag, and shoot as they move
4] capture: run enemy flag back to our base
5] defend: hunt and destroy nearest tank to our friendly flag bearing tank
